            <h3>Mind Up!</h3>
            <p>Our product mainly targets students but also extends to those in dire need of regulating their work time and breaks. Many high school students find themselves overloaded with work, leading to burnout and mental wellness issues that can affect their lives beyond school. This problem persists throughout life, as people often face stressful workloads without realizing how much they are pushing themselves. Our team aims to create a Google Chrome extension that can be easily installed to help manage daily tasks with regulated breaks and fun games to play during those breaks. Utilizing JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, we have developed a simple yet effective tool to assist with everyday tasks, easing the pressure on both students and adults. This extension includes a task manager where users can note their tasks, making it easier to manage a hectic schedule and save time by getting straight to what needs to be done.</p>
