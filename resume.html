            <h3>Influential Speakers</h3>
            <p>This year, I've had the opportunity to hear from influential speakers. One key takeaway from their talk was learning about AGILE and SCRUM which helped me make teams and make sure my product was finished on time. Their career inspired me because it showed me the hardships and it also showed me how easy my career path really is.</p>
            <h3>Mentor Experience</h3>
            <p>My Teacher, Mr.Baez  taught me important lessons, such as code blocking and how it can help design your website and how html can be used in many ways, but the only way html really works is with CSS. These lessons were crucial for my development in Computer Science.</p>
            <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
            <p>During my Volunteer experiences at the library I learned how to use a computer without coding, but just using the computer in ways like reseting passwords through the computer, and doing some ethical hacking to some computers to recover lost passwords, since my main job at the library was to help people with their technical problems.</p>
